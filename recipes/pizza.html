    <h3>
        <p>
            Save money by making this delicious NY-Style Pizza at home. 
            After the initial cost of supplies (i.e. Pizza stone/steel, pizza peel), 
            you can make this recipe at home for less than $5.00. The wife and I make this 
            recipe once or twice a week. <em>This recipe requires some knowledge of stretching pizza dough 
            and using a pizza peel.</em>
        </p>

        <p>Ingredients (Makes 2 12" pizzas)</p>
            <ul>
                <p>Dough:</p>
                <li>430g Flour</li>
                <li>270g Water</li>
                <li>5g Kosher salt</li>
                <li>3 tspn Olive oil</li>
                <li>4g Active yeast (NOT NUTRIONAL!)</li>
                <p>Sauce:</p>
                <li>Can of unsalted/unsweeted tomatoes</li>
                <li>6oz Tomato paste</li>
                <li>5g Kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 tspn Black pepper</li>
                <li>Slice of onion (optional)</li>
                <li>1 tspn Minced garlic (optional)</li>
                <p>Other:</p>
                <li>1lb Shredded mozzarella</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <ol>
            <p>Preparing the dough:</p>

            <p>For the best taste, allow dough to cold ferment in the fridge for 48-72 hours 
                prior to cooking.
            </p>

            <li>Mix flour, olive oil, and salt together in a mixing bowl</li>

            <li>In a separate bowl/container, mix lukewarm water, sugar, and yeast 
                together
            </li>

            <li>Combine the two bowls and mix together with a fork (I find forks more 
                effective without a dough mixer)
            </li>

            <li>Once the dough has formed a solid mass, place the mixture on the counter 
                and begin kneading the dough until smooth
            </li>

            <li>Once the dough is done, split into 2 equal balls of dough</li>
            
            <li>Roll the dough into balls, oil 2 bowls or a tray to prevent sticking,
                 place into separate bowls or on a tray and cover.
            </li>

            <li>Let ferment for 48-72 hours in the fridge</li>

            <p>While sacrificing flavor, you can make the pizza immediately by letting them ferment on counter 
                for ~1 hour
            </p>

            <p>Prep and bake:</p>
            
            <li>Place pizza stone or steal in empty oven on the bottom rack and preheat oven to 
                500-520Â°F and let heat for 60-90 minutes
            </li>
            
            <li>Blend sauce ingredients until desired smoothness</li>

            <li>Rub flour onto the surface of the pizza peel to prevent the dough from sticking</li>

            <li>Cover the pizza dough in flour to prevent sticking and stretch evenly to about 12" 
                depending on the size of pizza peel and stone/steel
            </li>

            <li>Place the dough on floured pizza peel</li>

            <li>With a large spoon or ladle, distribute desired amount of pizza sauce </li>
            
            <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella over the sauced area</li>

            <li>Add additional toppings if desired</li>

            <li>Transfer pizza from peel to stone and let bake for 7-10 minutes or until crust has risen and 
                reached a golden brown
            </li>
            <li>Use pizza peel to remove pizza from stone, cut, and serve</li>
        </ol>

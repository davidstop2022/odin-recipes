            After the initial cost of supplies (i.e. Pizza stone/steel, pizza peel),

        <p>Ingredients (Makes 2 12" pizzas)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>430g Flour</li>
                <li>270g Water</li>
                <li>Can of unsalted/unsweeted tomatoes</li>
                <li>6oz Tomato paste</li>
                <li>10g Kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 tspn Black pepper</li>
                <li>Slice of onion (optional)</li>
                <li>1 tspn Minced garlic</li>
                <li>1lb Shredded mozzarella</li>
                <li>3 tspn Olive oil</li>
                <li>4g Active yeast (NOT NUTRIONAL!)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <ol>
            <p>Preparing the dough:</p>

            <p>For the best taste, allow dough to cold ferment in the fridge for 48-72 hours 
                prior to cooking.
            </p>

            <li>Mix flour, olive oil, and salt together in a mixing bowl</li>

            <li>In a separate bowl/container, mix lukewarm water, sugar, and yeast 
                together
            </li>

            <li>Combine the two bowls and mix together with a fork (I find forks more 
                useful for mixing dough at home)
            </li>

            <li>Once the dough has formed a solid mass, place the mixture on the counter 
                and begin kneading the dough until smooth
            </li>

            <li>Once the dough is done, split into 2 equal balls of dough</li>
            
            <li>Roll the dough into balls, oil 2 bowls or a tray to prevent sticking,
                 place into separate bowls or on a tray and cover.
            </li>

            <li>Let ferment for 48-72 hours in the fridge</li>

            <p>You can make the pizza immediately by letting them ferment on counter 
                for ~1 hour, but you will be sacrificing flavor
            </p>
